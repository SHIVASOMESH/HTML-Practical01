    <h1>What films, if any, do geniuses enjoy?</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        At the risk of sticking my neck out, I will give two movies that really talked to me that both coincidentally starred Robin Williams. <br> The first was Dead Poets Society. I watched this movie shortly after deciding to go to MIT to study Chemistry instead of going to graduate school in English Literature. <br> It was very poignant, and Ethan Hawke starred as Todd Anderson, which was justâ€¦weird. The second movie was Good Will Hunting that I saw a couple of years after graduating MIT. <br> Like Matt Damons character, I grew up in a very low income, working class setting, and I found myself headed in the right direction at the end of the film.
